# Open items

Every unchecked item that is not already a task in `docs/audit/2026-10-01/TASKS.md`. One line each; delete
the line when it is done or moved into a plan.

## Carried over from the 2026 H1 audit (`docs/history/AUDIT-2026-H1.md`)

- **DOC03** — feature docs as a release requirement: a changed feature updates its owning doc in the same
  change. Superseded by the `AGENTS.md` checklist once WP7.4 merges `docs/FEATURE_REFERENCE.md` into wiki 1.
- Keep `docs/FEATURE_REFERENCE.md` current for large features until WP7.4 removes it.
- UI command "Create plugin from template" (copy `plugins/default_plugin`, rename, open the prompt file).
  WP5.4 delivers the generator (`tools/new_plugin.py`); the menu entry is still unplanned.

## Found during WP0

- `scripts/deploy.py::bump_version` does not handle the `-dev` suffix (`0.3.141-dev` comes back unchanged)
  and `update_changelog` expects a `# Changelog` heading the file no longer has. Releases are done by hand
  through the deploy skill, so the script is effectively unused — fix it or delete it in WP7.5.
- `AGENTS.md` "Read next" should point at `docs/INDEX.md` once WP7.1 creates it.
- `docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_MANIFESTO.md`, `docs/FEATURE_REFERENCE.md` and `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY_AND_AUDIT.md`
  still tell agents to update `GEMINI.md` / `AUDIT.md`; both are gone as working files (WP7.4 merges these
  docs).
- Root `CHANGELOG.md` is ~38 KB after archiving: the last 14 days hold 17 verbose release entries. New
  entries are one line each; consider cutting the window to the current minor at the next release.
